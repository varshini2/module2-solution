            <h2 id="chicken">Golden Retriever</h2>
            <p>The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America’s most popular dog breeds.
               They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience
                and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.

            <p>That face! Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet expression! It’s no surprise that Shih Tzu owners have been so delighted with this little “Lion Dog” for a thousand years. Where Shih Tzu go, giggles and mischief follow.
